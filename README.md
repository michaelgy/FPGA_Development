In order to test on a local machine, you must follow:
1. [Jekyll on Windows](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/windows/)
2. [Github guide](https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll#creating-your-site)
3. Run: `bundle exec jekyll serve`

### Using Jekyll
+ Each markdown file must have a front matter at the beginning of the file(the code inside is in YAML):
```
